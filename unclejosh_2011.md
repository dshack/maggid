For a number of happy years long ago, our ancestor Jacob and his son Joseph
lived simple, sustainable lives in the prosperous wine country of Canaan. During a
famine, however—caused by a combination of climate change and poor planning—Jake
and Joe were forced to give up their small-scale sustainable winery and get jobs as
bureaucrats in Sacramento (then known as Egypt), where food and middle-management
white collar positions with healthy benefit packages were equally plentiful. Jacob retired
in a time when 401Ks still had value, and his son Joseph soon rose to high position
writing environmental policy in the Pharaoh’s court. Led by Joseph, our people were
well-respected and well-regarded, comfortable and secure in the power structure of the
time despite an innately unnatural suburban lifestyle and a general dearth of good bagels.

Generations passed and our people remained in the central valley of Egypt. As
rulers came and went, a new Pharaoh ascended to the throne, brought into power in a
wave of bigoted but charismatic demagoguery, strange religion, and high ratings on his
daily Fox News talk show. The new Pharaoh felt threatened by the strangers and
immigrants in his people’s midst, and noting that we wore funny hats, smelled of gefilte
fish, and routinely failed to watch our fair share of NASCAR, he ordered our people
enslaved. Fearing rebellion, Pharaoh decreed that all Hebrew boy-children be sent to
semi-religious charter schools in the suburbs to learn about illuminated tablets and wear
funny underwear. Blocked by activist judges opposed to bussing, however, he decided he
would just kill them and eat their brains instead.

Realizing that the Pharaoh’s conservative patriarchal health care advisors had no
knowledge of or interest in stable family planning—or in their constituents’ long-term
reproductive health—two midwives named Shifrah and Puah defied Pharaoh’s orders to
put the newborn Jewboys to death (a policy cleverly written into the back end of a series
of pro-life bills), and through their courage, one little k’nadle survived.

Fearing for his safety, the newborn’s family cautiously and reasonably placed the
helpless infant in a leaky wicker basket that they found on craigslist (listed as a two
bedroom with on-site laundry). They floated him off, alone, covered by a light sheet,
down one of the largest and now most polluted rivers in the world, the Nile. Which
seemed like a reasonable thing to do at the time.

The lucky little Yid floated on down the Nile, and it was not long until he was
found...and adopted...by the Pharaoh’s daughter...which was really no big deal and
probably not a miracle or anything worth spending much time on in the story because it
probably happens all the time. In fact, Pharaoh’s daughter named him Moses, which
scholars believe to have been derived from the Egyptian for, “I found him floating around
in the water and decided to keep him, which is totally normal, right?” In another
complete coincidence that’s also probably no big deal, Pharaoh hired the boy’s own

mother as his wet-nurse. You know, no biggie. Thus he survived to adulthood, raised as
Prince of Egypt.

Although a child of privilege, as Moses grew he became aware of the slaves who
worked in the public sector jobs of his adoptive father and his father’s friend, the Pharaoh
of Wisconsin, who was a real shmuck. When Moses saw how much corporate managers
and CFOs earned in bonuses and compared it to the salaries of teachers and union
workers stripped of their collective bargaining power, he became angry, and he struck
and killed a CEO. Fearing retribution, he set out across the Death Valley of the Sanai
alone to hide out and maybe do a little Peyote and get a little weird with Charlie Sheen
for a while.

There in the desert, God spoke to Moses (who was definitely not doing Peyote at
the time, of course). Very cleverly, God disguised himself as a burning bush, which
though it flamed was not consumed—a nice touch, but not a particularly convincing
disguise. Moses knew it was the voice of God. The divine burning foliage called on
Moses to lead the Hebrew people to freedom.

Moses demurred. He argued with God (in retrospect, this was probably a bad
choice, God being who He was and all). Moses pled inadequacy. Citing omniscience,
God disagreed. Moses tried to reschedule. In the end, God beat Moses in a rosham and
that was it. God threw rock every time and beat Moses two out of three, so Moses had to
go lead the Jews out of Egypt. Good old rock.

Moses returned to Egypt and went to Pharaoh to argue the injustice of slavery and
the need for Pharaoh to reconsider dismantling Egypt’s social welfare systems. He gave
Pharaoh a famous mandate that resounds through history in the voice of the late Charlton
Heston:

“Let my people go.”  

Pharaoh refused.  

“Okay,” said Moses, “well then at least provide my people with health care,

mortgage relief, and a decent wage.”
Pharaoh again refused.

Moses warned him that Mighty God would strike down the Egyptian people,
bringing plagues upon the land.

Moses said, “Let my people go.”  

And Pharaoh refused.  

And God, who had been reading through the Twilight series in an effort to better

connect with his teenage daughter (who was feeling depressed and unappreciated in
anticipation of millennia of neglect in favor of her younger brother), turned the Nile to
blood.

And Moses said, “Hey, Pharaoh, let my people go.”  

And Pharaoh refused.  

And then a whole bunch of frogs emerged from the river of blood to infest the

land, which we’re pretty sure was also an act of God.
And Moses said, “Let my people go.”  

And Pharaoh refused.

And then lice emerged from the masses of dead frogs, which was really gross and
pretty obnoxious, but possibly not the work of God, though He did tip off a nice Jewish
family that it would be a good time to go into the delousing shampoo business.

Moses at this point got into his Subaru and went down to REI and used his
dividend to get himself a big old hiking staff to make himself look a little more rugged.
Then he went back to Pharaoh and said, “let my people go.”

And still Pharaoh refused.  

So God, building on the success of the lice, sent swarms of insects into Egypt.
And Moses pounded his new staff on the ground and said “Let my people go!”
And Pharaoh refused.  

And then God killed all the cows, and the price of chicken nuggets crashed for the

first few days and then shot through the roof, which, because of the high demand for
chicken, led to an egg shortage, and the whole of industrial agriculture went through a
series of economic shocks while the local organic farms—coincidentally run by Jews—
made a killing.

“Let my people go!” said Moses.
But Pharaoh refused.  

God gave all the Egyptians boils.
“How ‘bout now?” asked Moses.
Pharaoh refused.

Then it hailed. This might have been a meteorological coincidence, but it did
some serious damage to the remaining crops throughout Egypt, and Moses hoped to
capitalize on it by calling it an act of God. God was watching pre-runs of Game 5 of the
2010 World Series, and didn’t mind having his name associated with the hail, especially
after Aubrey Huff laid down a sacrifice bunt in the top of the 7th to advance the runners.

“So...how ‘bout now?” asked Moses.  

But Pharaoh (a Dodgers fan) refused.  

Then there were locusts. Same outcome. Then darkness, which was pretty

undeniably God’s doing, and one that nobody saw coming (it being dark and all). But
darkness also proved ineffective, which seems to have gotten God’s attention, because
then he got mad and decided to start killing people. He thought he’d begin with every
first-born son in Egypt.

When God, who had by now ditched the burning bush getup in favor of the more
familiar voice-from-above ensemble, told Moses what He wanted to do, Moses was a
little shocked.

“Every first born son in the land of Egypt, huh?” Moses asked. “Jews, too?”

“Well, that would send kind of a mixed message, now wouldn’t it,” God said.
“I’ll tell you what. Get all the Jews to slaughter a lamb this evening, and wipe the lamb’s
blood over the doorways of Jewish houses. That way, I’ll know which houses to hit, and
which ones to pass over.” God liked the sound of that idea, especially when he said “pass
over” in a way that emphasized the “ass” and rolled over the “o” like “PASSover.” That
sounded good.

Moses nodded his head, thinking about what a weird dude God was. Then he
started wondering how God was going to deal with passing over all the Jews living in
lofts and downtown apartments in the same buildings as Egyptians after Pharaoh’s banks
had foreclosed on their houses, and what the landlords would say about smearing lamb’s

blood on the newly painted moldings of the Union Building down on Fifth Street,
especially now that they had fired and deported everyone on the cleaning staff in order to
compensate for the parent company’s executive bonuses.

“Jesus, Moses, I’ll figure it out,” God said.

When he found the first-born sons of Egypt dead in the morning, Pharaoh decided
to cut his losses and told Moses to get his people together and hit the road. You know, or
he’d go ahead and kill them all and stuff.

Drops for the Ten Plagues: We commemorate the ten plagues that God sent down tot he
Egyptians on our behalf with drops of wine on our plate. We place a drop on the plate as
we say the name of each plague. They are:

Blood, Frogs, Lice, Insects, Cattle, Boils, Hail, Locusts, Darkness, First-Born

Fearful that Pharaoh would change his mind, our people fled in a hurry. Instead
of packing fresh bagels and lox and a nice baguette with organic brie like they imagined
normal Jews would, you know, if they ever went camping, our people had to slap
together some flower and water and bake it pronto. Only later did they realize the stuff
had the texture of saltines and the flavor of cardboard. We called it Matzah, and we eat it
as a mitzvah eight days a year instead of bread, which always seems like a good idea on
the first night but gets old after half a box.

It’s unclear exactly why, but shortly after our fateful culinary blunder and our
hasty departure, Pharaoh decided to send his army after us to bring us back. Some have
suggested the Egyptian stock exchange crashed when so many prominent financial
management professionals moved their holdings into off-shore accounts and fled the
country, prompting the Pharaoh to reevaluate his decision as soon as the opening bell
sounded. For my money, I think he came after us because we took his daughter with us,
which, in retrospect, may have been another in a long series of bad decisions.

In any case, Pharaoh’s army followed us to the sea. Like a meshuggeneh, Moses
managed to lead us to the edge of an impassable body of salt water. And like schmucks,
we plunged in after him. When we had gone as far as we could, however, God parted the
waters for us to cross. Pharaoh and his army pursued, but when we arrived at the far
edge, the waters that God had parted quite suddenly ceased to be apart. We mourn, even
now, that Pharaoh’s army drowned; our liberation is bittersweet because people died in
our pursuit. We feel a little guilty. After all, we are Jews.

And thus God led us out of bondage in Egypt...and into the desert...for forty
years. But that’s another story for another day that we like to gloss over with dayenus.

To this day we relive our liberation, that we may not become complacent, that we
may always rejoice in our freedom.
