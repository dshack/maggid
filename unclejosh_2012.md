For a number of happy years long ago, our ancestor Jacob and his son Joseph
lived simple, sustainable lives in the prosperous wine country of Canaan. During a
famine, however—which we can say with 90% certainty was the product of global
warming—Jake and Joe were forced to give up their small-scale sustainable winery and
get jobs as bureaucrats in Sacramento (then known as Egypt), where food and middle-
management white collar positions with healthy benefit packages were equally plentiful.
Jacob retired in a time when 401Ks still had value, and his son Joseph soon rose to high
position writing environmental policy in the Pharaoh’s court. Led by Joseph, our people
were well-respected and well-regarded, comfortable and secure in the power structure of
the time despite an innately unnatural suburban lifestyle and a general dearth of good
bagels.

Generations passed and our people remained in the central valley of Egypt.  

Rulers came and went, and soon three new would-be Pharaohs began to make claims to
the throne, one brought into power by cunning, one by money and strange religion, and
the third by intolerance, tenacity, and overall creepiness. The new candidates for Pharaoh
all felt threatened by the strangers and immigrants in their people’s midst, and noting that
we wore funny hats, smelled of gefilte fish, and routinely failed to watch our fair share of
NASCAR, the three wannabe Pharaohs agreed during a televised debate to order our
people, the Jews, enslaved. Fearing rebellion, the frontrunner for Pharaoh decreed that
all Hebrew boy-children be sent to semi-religious charter schools in the suburbs to learn
about illuminated tablets and wear magic underwear. But he was soon blocked by
activist judges opposed to bussing, which allowed the creepiest of the would-be Pharaohs
to declare that he would kill the Jews and eat our brains instead. After further discussion
and four lengthy committee meetings, it was finally decided that all firstborn Jewish boys
would simply be put to death, and the measure was passed as a rider on a military
appropriations bill the next day.

For two midwives of Egypt, Shifrah and Puah, the new directive seemed like a
bad idea. Unconvinced that infanticide promoted long term family stability and
reproductive health, they defied Pharaoh’s orders to put the newborn Jewboys to death.
Through their courage, one little k’nadle survived.2

Fearing for his safety, the newborn’s wet-nurses cautiously and reasonably placed
the helpless infant in a leaky wicker basket that they found on craigslist (listed as a two
bedroom with on-site laundry). They floated him off, alone, covered by a light sheet,
down one of the largest and now most polluted rivers in the world. It seemed like a
reasonable thing to do at the time.

The lucky little Yid floated on down the Nile, and it was not long until he was
found...and adopted...by none other than the front-running Pharaoh’s daughter...which
was really no big deal and probably not a miracle or anything worth spending much time
on in the story because it probably happens all the time. In fact, Pharaoh’s daughter
named him Moses, which scholars believe to have been derived from the Egyptian for, “I
found him floating around in the water and decided to keep him, which is totally normal,
right?” In another complete coincidence that’s also probably no big deal, Pharaoh hired
the boy’s own mother as his wet-nurse. You know, no biggie. Thus he survived to
adulthood, raised as Prince of Egypt.

Although a child of extreme privilege, as Moses grew he became aware of the
slaves who worked for and were laid off by his adoptive father at his corporate offices
around the world. When Moses saw that his new father figure made millions of dollars
and paid an effective 15% tax rate while the other 99% of the population paid more while
trying to make ends meet on measly salaries, he joined the “Occupy Giza” Movement
and wound up killing a distracted CEO who wandered into the camp while making deals
on his Blackberry.

Fearing retribution, Modes set out across the Death Valley of the Sanai alone to
hide out...well, that and maybe do a little Peyote and get a little weird with Charlie Sheen
for a while.

There in the desert, God spoke to Moses (who was definitely not doing Peyote at
the time, of course). Very cleverly, God disguised himself as a burning bush, which
though it flamed was not consumed—a nice touch, but not a particularly convincing
disguise. Moses knew it was the voice of God. The divine burning foliage called on
Moses to lead the Hebrew people to freedom.

Moses demurred. He argued with God (in retrospect, this was probably a bad
choice, God being who He was and all). Moses pled inadequacy. Citing omniscience,
God disagreed. Moses tried to reschedule. In the end, God beat Moses in a rosham and
that was it. God threw the rock of Gibraltar every time and beat Moses two out of three,
so Moses had to go lead the Jews out of Egypt. Good old rock of Gibraltar.

2 A k’nadle is literally a dumpling. Or a cute kid.

Moses returned to Egypt and went to the magic underwear Pharaoh to argue the
injustice of slavery and the need for Pharaoh’s party to reconsider dismantling Egypt’s
social welfare systems. He gave all the would-be Pharaohs a famous mandate that
resounds through history in the voice of the late Charlton Heston:

“Let my people go.”  

The would-be Pharaohs refused.  

“Okay,” said Moses, “well then at least let this current Pharaoh try to provide my

people with health care, mortgage relief, and a decent wage.”
The Pharaohs again refused.

Moses warned them that Mighty God would strike down the Egyptian people,
bringing plagues upon the land.

Moses said, “Let my people go.”  

And the would-be Pharaohs refused.  

And God, who had been reading through the Twilight series in an effort to better

connect with his teenage daughter (who was feeling depressed and unappreciated in
anticipation of millennia of neglect in favor of her younger brother), turned the Nile to
blood.

And Moses said, “Hey, Pharaohs, let my people go.”  

And the would-be Pharaohs refused.  

And then a whole bunch of frogs emerged from the river of blood to infest the

land, which we’re pretty sure was also an act of God.  

And Moses said, “Let my people go.”  

And the would-be Pharaohs refused.  

And then lice emerged from the masses of dead frogs, which was really gross and

pretty obnoxious, but possibly not the work of God, though He did tip off a nice Jewish
family that it would be a good time to go into the delousing shampoo business.

Moses at this point got into his Subaru and went down to REI and used his
dividend to get himself a big old hiking staff to make himself look a little more rugged.
Then he went back to would-be Pharaohs and said, “let my people go.”

And still all the would-be Pharaohs refused.  

So God, building on the success of the lice, sent swarms of insects into Egypt.
And Moses pounded his new staff on the ground and said “Let my people go!”

He thought is sounded pretty authoritative.  

But the would-be Pharaohs refused.  

And then God killed all the cows, and the price of chicken nuggets crashed for the

first few days and then shot through the roof, which, because of the high demand for
chicken, led to an egg shortage, and the whole of industrial agriculture went through a
series of economic shocks while the local organic farms—coincidentally run by Jews—
made a killing.

“Let my people go!” said Moses.
But the would-be Pharaohs refused.
God gave all the Egyptians boils.
“How ‘bout now?” asked Moses.
The would-be Pharaohs refused.

Then it hailed. This might have been a meteorological coincidence, but it did
some serious damage to the remaining crops throughout Egypt, and Moses hoped to
capitalize on it by calling it an act of God. God was watching pre-runs of Game 5 of the
2010 World Series, and didn’t mind having his name associated with the hail, especially
after Aubrey Huff laid down a sacrifice bunt in the top of the 7th to advance the runners.

“So...how ‘bout now?” asked Moses.  

But the would-be Pharaohs (Dodgers fans, all of them) refused.  

Then there were locusts. Same outcome. Then darkness, which was pretty

undeniably God’s doing, and one that nobody saw coming (it being dark and all). But
darkness also proved ineffective, which seems to have gotten God’s attention, because
then he got mad and decided to start killing people. He thought he’d begin with every
first-born son in Egypt.

When God, who had by now ditched the burning bush getup in favor of the more
familiar voice-from-above ensemble, told Moses what He wanted to do, Moses was a
little shocked.

“Every first born son in the land of Egypt, huh?” Moses asked. “Jews, too?”

“Well, that would send kind of a mixed message, now wouldn’t it,” God said.
“I’ll tell you what. Get all the Jews to slaughter a lamb this evening, and wipe the lamb’s
blood over the doorways of Jewish houses. That way, I’ll know which houses to hit, and
which ones to pass over.” God liked the sound of that idea, especially when he said “pass
over” in a way that emphasized the “ass” and rolled over the “o” like “PASSover.” That
sounded good.

Moses nodded his head, thinking about what a weird dude God was. Then he
started wondering how God was going to deal with passing over all the Jews living in
lofts and downtown apartments in the same buildings as Egyptians after magic underwear
Pharaoh’s corporations’ subsidiary banks had foreclosed on their houses, and what the
landlords would say about smearing lamb’s blood on the newly painted moldings of the
Union Building down on Fifth Street, especially now that they had fired and deported
everyone on the cleaning staff in order to compensate for the parent company’s executive
bonuses.

“Jesus, Moses, I’ll figure it out,” God said.

When he found the first-born sons of Egypt dead in the morning, the would-be
Pharaohs had another debate, and, after some filibustering, passed a resolution to cut their
losses. They told Moses to get his people together and hit the road. You know, or they’d
all be killed and stuff.

Drops for the Ten Plagues: We commemorate the ten plagues that God sent down tot he
Egyptians on our behalf with drops of wine on our plate. We place a drop on the plate as
we say the name of each plague. They are:

Blood, Frogs, Lice, Insects, Cattle, Boils, Hail, Locusts, Darkness, First-Born

Fearful that that the sometimes progressive but often backward magic underwear
Pharaoh would change his mind, our people fled in a hurry. Instead of packing fresh
bagels and lox and a nice baguette with organic brie like they imagined normal Jews
would, you know, if they ever went camping, our people had to slap together some flour

and water and bake it pronto. Only later did they realize the stuff had the texture of
saltines and the flavor of cardboard. We called it Matzah, and we eat it as a mitzvah eight
days a year instead of bread, which always seems like a good idea on the first night but
gets old after half a box.

It’s unclear exactly why, but shortly after our fateful culinary blunder and our
hasty departure, the would-be Pharaohs’ party decided to send the army after us to bring
us back. Some have suggested the Egyptian stock exchange crashed when so many
prominent financial management professionals moved their holdings into off-shore
accounts and fled the country, prompting the magic underwear Pharaoh to reevaluate his
decision as soon as the opening bell sounded. Some evidence suggests that the would-be
Pharaohs’ party just kind of likes sending troops on vague and unrealistic missions in that
part of the world. For my money, I think the magic underwear Pharaoh came after us
because we took his daughter with us, which, in retrospect, may have been another in a
long series of bad decisions.

In any case, magic underwear Pharaoh’s army followed us to the sea. Like a
meshuggeneh, Moses managed to lead us to the edge of an impassable body of salt water.
And like schmucks, we plunged in after him. When we had gone as far as we could,
however, God parted the waters for us to cross. Magic underwear Pharaoh and his army
pursued, but when we arrived at the far edge, the waters that God had parted quite
suddenly ceased to be apart. We mourn, even now, that magic underwear Pharaoh’s
army drowned; our liberation is bittersweet because people died in our pursuit. We feel a
little guilty. After all, we are Jews.

And thus God led us out of bondage in Egypt...and into the desert...for forty
years. But that’s another story for another day that we like to gloss over with dayenus.

To this day we relive our liberation, that we may not become complacent, that we
may always rejoice in our freedom.
